"Natural Language Processing" is one of the very vast topic and one of it's great product in our day-to-day life is Alexa. But in this project, we will be creating a "Review Based System for Restaurant".Here we will have a dataset consisting of thousands of reviews of customer, whether the food was delicious or not. When we trained our dataset and test it's accuracy, it got an result of 73% accuracy rate. Techniques such as Cleaning the text, PorterStemmer, Stopwords, Bag of Words, etc. are used in this model. Now this rating can be used in rating of restaurant in Zomato, Swiggy, etc. For example, taking all the positive comment and calculating the average of that positive rating and giving it a rating on a scale of 5 or something else.
